# Soccer-Game

A graphic soccer game implemented using the JFrame library I wrote as part of my coursework in the "Object Oriented Programming" course.

There are two game modes:

1 - AI versus AI - The two groups simply play against each other ad infinitum.

2 - User versus AI - The user controls the red players whenever one gains control of the ball.

Use the up and down keys in order to move player holding the ball
Use the right and left keys in order to give the player the direction you want
Use the Space bar in order to kick the ball in the direction the player is facing
Be sure to click on the window frame so the keyboard events are recieved by the program

note: in either game mode, clicking on a random point in the window will relocate the ball 
to that point along with its current velocity(vector and speed).
